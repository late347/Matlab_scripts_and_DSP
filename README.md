# Matlab_scripts_and_DSP


-contains some matlab scripts from school math exercises

-also has some filter design for digital-signals-processing filters

-NOTE!!!

it is possible that those Session2 matlab exercises may contain mistake somewhere, because teacher didnt give full points from those Session2.m files

-it is possible that other matlabs also contain bugs, but hopefully not too much
